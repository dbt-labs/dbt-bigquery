## dbt-bigquery 1.6.0-b4 - June 23, 2023

### Features

- Support model contracts + constraints on nested columns ([#673](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-bigquery/issues/673))

### Fixes

- test model constraints with sql headers ([#7714](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-bigquery/issues/7714))
- Pass python model timeout to polling operation so model execution times out as expected. ([#577](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-bigquery/issues/577))

### Dependencies

- Rm explicit agate pin, in favor of transitive dependency from dbt-core ([#777](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-bigquery/pull/777))
