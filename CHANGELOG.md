### Features
- Add grants to materializations ([#198](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-bigquery/issues/198), [#212](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-bigquery/pull/212))

- Fix validate connection failing ([#168](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-bigquery/pull/168))

### Under the hood
- Modify `BigQueryColumn.numeric_type` to always exclude precision + scale, since the functionality of ["parametrized data types on BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#parameterized_data_types) is highly constrained ([#214](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-bigquery/pull/214))
